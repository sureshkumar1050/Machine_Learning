Objective :  
    The primary objectives of the Fundus Glaucoma Detection project are to develop an accurate and efficient automated system for identifying glaucoma from fundus images. This includes optimizing image preprocessing techniques, implementing state-of-the-art feature extraction methods, and deploying a machine learning model with a focus on high sensitivity and specificity.
